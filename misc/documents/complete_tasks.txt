-Inside of this directory, will be the sources and the backups. *
-After finish the first script, do a backup with specific name (without the sources). *
-Move the finished directory from the project, to sources directory, along with the temp_sources. *
-Second script: Build a script that reads all the data from the TXT files and do the following for each email address: *
1. Check if the email address already found in the database. *
2. If not found - Do validation on the email address. *
3. Add the domain part of the email address to a new table, domains (will be name and count) - If not exists add, if exists add to count. *
-Run the script. *
-While the script running, take back from the sources the implement to fix documents. *
-Merge all domains into one TXT file and delete the rest. *
-After the script finish, save the results in the end in another place. *
-Once the script end, Do a backup. *
-Delete all places that can drop the table. *

A. Domain counter by the most count. *
B. All exists domain by order name ascending. *
-Run the script. *
-After the script finish, save the results in the end in another place (same place of the first results). *
-Do a backup. *
-Build new script that pull all the domains from the database, for each domain attach 'test', and validates it - Canccelled. *
-Save the results for somewhere else - Canccelled. *
-Save all the new data (saved in another place) in the sources directory - Canccelled. *
-Do a backup - Canccelled. *
-After 2 scripts done, go back to the original Crawler (this project). *

-Go over all the bugs and list them in this document - Move them into one document. *
-Merge all the bugs need to be fixed - into one document. *
-Before any change made - Check for duplicates in the new document - Canccelled. *
-For that, create agagin the "CrawlerLogic", and build a script that find domains  - Canccelled. *
 (from email addresses or not) in the sources document and count the duplicate domains and check why they are duplicated - Canccelled. *
-Remove the duplicate domains from the sources document - Canccelled. *
-Scan all the invalid email addresses / fixes and list them in the new document. *
-Scan the domains alfabethic log, get the popular domain mistakes. *
-After finish to fix all - Build a script to validate all email addresses from original validation email addresses - Cancelled. *
 Compare between the old fixed and the new ones - Make sure all fixed and correct - Cancelled. *
-Do a backup of the sources_tasks.txt. *
-To get the real domain counts - Most popular domains, need to scan all the files and count the domains. *
 1. For that, need to scan all of the sources again (found in backup in iOmega sources) - Scan all files to 1 file of total domain counts. *
 2. For the sources of pflogsummarymailrelay.txt - Find a way to add them. *
-Most common domains: C:\Or\Web\Crawler\Sources\FixesToImplement\pflogsummarymailrelay.txt + pflogsummarymailrelay2.txt (Implement in common domains?). *
-Identical endings (need to think what to do about what to do with it - maybe for each one of them - it's one typos). *
-Take all the typos of the popular domains - Merge them in the source document by typos / global fix / singles (not need fix / co.il / com). *
-Do a backup of the crawler before any change. *

-Comment the function of 'fixDomainReplaceCommonMistakes'. *
-Comment all references all over the application of 'emailAddressReplaceTypos'. *
-Remove the file of 'emailAddressConfigurations.configuration.js' from all application - Cancelled. *
-Group all edge cases that require surgical logic to the a new function. *
-Group of replace, Group of special logic, ect... *
-Implement all in the 'Here' section. Call the new function 'fixEdgeCases'. *
-In the generator test script, in the section of 'mayMisspellEmailAddress', *
 implement all of the above in random email addresses. *
 (in emailAddressConfigurations.configuration - Make a list there of all the above). *
-Groups: (Do the logic in the following order - A MUST) - *
#. Replace with @: - *
@. - *
@_ - *
//@@@@----DOMAIN PART ONLY----@@@@// - *
-Replace all '_' with '-'. in the domain part only. - *
.- - *
#. If the second word is not a domain end, replace with '-'. - *
#. If the second word is a domain end, Remove the '-'. - *
-. - *
#. Replace '-.' => If the second word is not a domain end, replace with '-'. - *
#. Replace '-.' => If the second word is a domain end, Remove the '-'. - *
-co.il - *
If the domain end seperated by -, replace it with . - *
-the replace of the '_' with '-' need to be first logic, since need to remove '-.' *
-(if after the @ there is '-' or '_', remove it (only the first one)). *
-.co.il (check if the end is seperated by _). *
-.gov.il (check if the end is seperated by _). *
-all places where '_' in domain part - replace with '-'. *
-It's OK, but move the logic into higher scope of functions: EdgeCaseFix. Inside this functions insert all the edge cases. *
-Add logic: *
-1. In domain part, if contains '_' in the middle - Convert it to '-'. *
-2. All the rest of the special charecters - Remove. *

2. Create 2 enums of SearchKeyGender: MALE, FEMALE, BOTH and SearchKeyType: NEED, PERSON, PROFESSION, RELATION, CITY, EMAIL_ADDRESS. *
3. Backup all the search keys. *
4. Fill the classes (+add more or remove if needed). *
5. Change the logic of generate search keys accordingly. *
-Fix this: pkupot@moh.health.gov.i (fix fixDomainEnd function). *

Tasks From Production Tests: *
============================ *
1. Create enum of male / female / both - Cancelled. *
2. Separate all the keys for male / female / both - Cancelled. *
3. Change the logic of the search key to add search key by male / female / both - Cancelled. *

 Don't forget to write about it on README.md file. *
-Add the real logic of crawling source with puppeteer.js - Take it from one of the sources *
 (implement also load time and timeout time + make sure not to load styles and images). *
-On tests, when you test 'walla.com' you will see nothing is valid. Need to add 'alsoKnownAs' or field like that. *
-It will be done by array that updates each module of 7 new email addresses. *
-At home, copy the settings for DupChecker and search for duplicates logics and refactor them with the plugin for that. *

Email address modify service: *
============================= *
-Create the new file. *
-Move all email address stuff to the new service. *
-Move the logic from text.utils.js to the new file. *
-Remove the 'Rename' status - Will be merged with 'Fix'. *
-The result will be return as the following: - Cancelled. *
status (new enum: Add, Exist, Invalid, Rename, Fix, Filter), - Cancelled. *
the new email address. The logic will add the counters according to the result. - Cancelled. *
-Use booleans instead of enum statuses. *
-On the first fix - break the loop - Cancelled. *
-Don't forget to put all of this method inside a promise and perform async await on it. *
-Re-edit all the common mistakes from Jumbo into class with all the mistakes and the domain fix. *
-In the end of each step, return the appropriate result according *
 to check if equal to the original email address. *
-The method will be separated to several functionalities: *
1. Check if the email address is invalid and can be fixed. *
2. Check if the email address domain is valid and need to be renamed. *
3. Check if the email domain is filtered. *
4. Check if exists and insert to database. *

1. Email Address Validation: *
---------------------------- *
-Add validation on email address length: *
'There is a length limit on email addresses. That limit is a maximum of 64 characters (octets) in the 'local part' *
(before the '@') and a maximum of 255 characters (octets) in the domain part (after the '@') for a total length of 320 characters'. *
-Add the new fixed from the source TXT file. *
-Return 'Fix' or 'Invalid'. *

2. Email Address Domain Check: *
------------------------------ *
-At home, search in Jumbo code a task that have common email mistakes: *
 Go to JumboMail website and pull all rows of common mistakes - Send it to the gmail. *
-After taking the common mistakes, implement the logic here. *
-This section will be separated into several parts: *
A. Manually Domain Check: *
------------------------- *
-Implement a list of case and fix and check if it has been replaced. *
B. Auto Typo Check: *
------------------- *
-Remove all specific special characters. *
-Implement the function that fix typos. *
-Build function that create auto typo and check that the first function detect and fix all typos. *
-Add a list of valid domains (according to the common mistakes and will be added more later). *
-The fix typo function will be using this list. *
-In the initiate step, a random domain will be chosen and typo will be generated and will be tested - Cancelled. *
 (If any typo missed - it will throw exception). *
-Return 'Fix'. *

4. Email Address Save: *
---------------------- *
-Like the logic today. It's the last step. *
-Return 'Add' or 'Exists'. *
-If return 'Add' update also the 'Database'. *

Tasks: *
====== *
-Fix bug with with maximum processes, don't stop the loop. *
-Change the console status line: totalCount will be the total email addresses crawled. *
-New counter - "Save": valid email address, not filter / fix / exists / invalid, that saved in the database and logged to the TXT file. *
-Implement the logic of crawl email address according to the logic of the links service. *
-Add logic to add new counter - 'unsave'. Unsave it's when failed to save to the database. Log it to a separated TXT file. *
-Make enum of goal types: emailAddresses, time, links. *
-Add new class with all flags possible for the email address. *
-Fit the logic according to this class. *
-Add also field of status for logging, for the function on the log.service, so that the results for the log will be sent to the function with the status. *
-All the counters will be updated according to the flags of the result. *
-Add the logic to fit each of the statuses. *
-Order the statuses on the console status line according to the 'status_index.txt' document. *

-Add email address settings file and change all places accordingly. *
-generatorService will have 4 functions: getValidEmailAddress() and getInvalidEmailAddresses() - Return accordingly. *
-Change the "emailAddressTestCases.test.js" accordingly and check it works. *
-And have 2 functions: "getTypos" and "getEmailAddresses". *
-getTypos: *
{ *
localPart: *
domainPart: *
} *
-Each empty will be randomize. *
-Change 'emailAddressTypos.test.js' accordingly and check it. *
-getEmailAddresses() - All options will be inside, since it's a long list of flags. *
-All the settings of this function will be inside. *
-Build all the logic, then add all the flags. *
-There will be 2 main functions: random email address typos *
 (same as today + flag of random name or if not empty - the name selected + load the domainDetails from the generator), random email addresses. *
-The new function will create random email addresses with the following types of email addresses: *
1. Random a number between 100-500 of email addresses to randomize. *
2. Add flags for each type of pairs, to create email addresses of this type. *
3. According to the settings in the previous results. *
4. For each of the pairs, random a number that will all together match the maximum number from the section 1. *
5. Each pair will create a type of email address will be created from a different function - with the pair comments from here. *
6. For each array, random the type of email addresses. *
7. Each method will return the final email address that has been created, the local part and the domain part. *
8. Random number of emails by the following: *
{ *
  LocalPart: Random letters (settings: valid random size of part, insert numbers randomly, upperCase randomly). *
  DomainPart: Random valid domains from 'isCommonDomain=true' or random domain name with random end, no typos. *
}, *
{ *
  LocalPart: Random letters and randomly replace letters, numbers, special characters (random size of part). *
  DomainPart: Random letters and randomly replace letters, numbers, special characters (random size of part). *
}, *
{ *
  LocalPart: Random letters and randomly replace letters, numbers, special characters (random size of part). *
  DomainPart: TyposGenerator of domain common typos (use domainDetails list for random). *
}, *
{ *
  LocalPart: Random letters and randomly replace letters, numbers, special characters (random size of part). *
  DomainPart: Random common domain typos. IsCommonDomain='false', from the list. *
}, *
{ *
  LocalPart: Random letters and randomly replace letters, numbers, special characters (random size of part). *
  DomainPart: Random common domain typos. IsCommonDomain='true', from the list. *
}, *
{ *
  LocalPart: Merged valid and invalid email addresses lists, random local part of one of them. *
  DomainPart: TyposGenerator of domain common typos (use domainDetails list for random). *
}, *
{ *
  LocalPart: Merged valid and invalid email addresses lists, random local part of one of them. *
  DomainPart: Merged valid and invalid email addresses lists, random domain part of one of them. *
}, *
{ *
  LocalPart: Random letters and randomly replace letters, numbers, special characters (random size of part). *
  DomainPart: TyposGenerator of domain common typos (use domainDetails list for random) + Remove domain end. *
  DomainEnd: Random from 'emailAddressEndFixTypos'. *

-Change the logic on 'emailAddressTypos.test.js' accordingly. *
-Refactor the 'emailAddressesGenerator.service' with all the common logics. *
-Build 'emailAddress.utils' for common functions related to email address around the project. *

Fix Common Typos: *
================= *
-Need to be merged into one single list, remove the duplicates, and to keep only the last check, *
 before the validation (this.finalRenameEmailAddressManuallyTypo), and to cancel the check on (this.fixDomainCommonTypos). *

Fix Hardcoded Lists: *
==================== *
-Holding inside the code all kind of lists (email addresses, typos, filter email addresses, filter domains, domain ends, search keys) *
 it's a bad idea, because it's not dynamic, and each change need to go to the code and change it. Therefore, it need to be changed to be *
 hold in TXT files. *
--emailAddressCommonDomainTypos.js: *
-To hold all the typos in 2 lists and inside the js file it's bad idea. *
-Need to be merged into one single list, remove the duplicates, and to keep only the last check, *
 before the validation (this.finalRenameEmailAddressManuallyTypo), and to cancel the check on (this.fixDomainCommonTypos). *
--emailAddressesTestCases.js *
-Reload from external files, the valid and the invalid email addresses. *
--emailAddressSettings.js *
-Reload from external files, the *

Fix Typo Bugs: *
============== *
-Add field to CommonDomainTypo called "domainName" with the name of the domain - Cancelled. *
-Move the initiate of the common domains from the link service to the email address service. *
-Create another array of common domains without their end. *
-Create a function that split the domain from the last '.', and bring back only the domain name. *
-Build another function called "fixMicromatchTypos". *
-Build a function that gets a domain, and compare it with micromatch package to all of the domains without their endings. *
-The "fixMicromatchTypos" function will contain 4 calls to other functions: compare pure domain with end, *
 remove first letter, remove last letter, and remove all what is not 0-9a-z. After each of these functions *
 will ba a call to the compare with micromatch. If in any step there is a match, replace the domain and *
 resolve, don't continue with the rest of the functions. *
-Crate another list with all the domain names and the domain end: *
 ['gmail', 'com'], ['hotmail', 'com'], ['outlook', 'com'] (will be generated from the initiate link service). *
-Use micromatch to try to get the domain name. *
-Add the last step: *
a. Compare the domain to a list of common domains. *
b. If match - Resolve. The email address is OK. *
c. If doesn't match to any domain, use a new function: *
1. Split the domain to 2: domain name, domain end. *
2. Remove first and last letters of the domain name and compare (without domain end). If match - Resolve. *
3. Use micromatch with the list of all the domain names. If match - Resolve. *
-Try to solve typos of end domain. *
-Add another validation function - If email address ends with '.', remove last character. *
-Build function that check that the domain part contains ',', replace it with '.'. *
-Fix Common Typos: test@gmail,com *
-Fix all typos bugs. *
-Fix all email address validation bugs. *
-Continue to fill common mistakes for the followings: walla.com | walla.co.il | bezeqint.net *
-In the typo test - Add logic to change "isValid = false" if the domain don't match. *
-Add another field to "CommonDomainDomainTypo" named "finalList". *
-Fill the "finalList" for each domain. *
-Build another final version of replace common mistakes according to the "finalList". *
-After the new implementation - Add more typos to the "finalList" and re-check. *
-Finish the email address mistakes - Cancelled. *
-Remove duplicate cases in "validEmailAddresses" and "invalidEmailAddresses" and from the domainCommonTypos list (use online duplicate remover). *
-Refactor all emailAddressValidation.service.js for common logic - Build functions. *
-Build "testService" to all common functions in all .test.js files - Cancelled. *
 (check if repeated logic exists in 'emailAddressValidation.service.js', if so, take from there) - Cancelled. *

-b. Loop on the invalid email addresses list and check. *
-If invalid, put V. *
-If valid, put X. *
-If fix, put V. *
-Add to console: '✅' : '❌' *

-Log a score: 43/143 (34%). *
-Fix bug with "undefined" in the end of the email address. *

-Email Address Typo Fix: *
======================== *
-Pick on domain from the valid domains list. *
-use the typo service to generate typos. *
-Loop and check all the typos. *
-If Fix - Log V. *
